Here I am submitting a total of 8 jupyter notebooks—each file named according to what is done in it. I am explaining them. 

initial-eda-preprocessing-and-base-line-models: 
In this notebook, I did exploratory data analysis. I checked the baseline model prediction before preprocessing the dataset. Then data preprocessing was done. Again, the prediction of the baseline model was checked. In this case, the prediction was better than the previous prediction.

siemse_lstm-1-layer: 
A one-layer LSTM model was trained on a preprocessed dataset.

bilstm-2-layer: 
A two-layer LSTM model was trained on a preprocessed dataset.

cnn-1-layer to cnn-4-layers: 
Four CNN models with one, two, three, and four layers, respectively, were trained on the preprocessed dataset.

preprocessing-and-scattered-models:
This notebook includes preprocessing of the given dataset and training of different ANNs and LSTMs with varying numbers of epochs and layers to improve prediction accuracy.
